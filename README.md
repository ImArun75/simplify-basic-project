# User Profiles App (Beginner)

This is a single-page React application that fetches and displays user data from a public API. It's built as the first part of a two-assignment series, focusing on foundational React concepts.

## Features

- **API Integration**: Fetches an array of 10 user objects from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`.
- **Dynamic Avatars**: Generates unique user avatars using the DiceBear API based on each user's username.
- **Loading State**: Displays a loading indicator while the data is being fetched.
- **Component-based Structure**: Uses a `UserCard` component to render each individual profile, demonstrating the use of props and component reusability.
- **Styling**: Styled using Bootstrap for a clean and simple layout.
